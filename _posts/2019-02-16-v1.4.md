Released 1.4.

- Fixed keyboard input lag. Thanks to Victor Robertson.
- Do not enter xkill mode if Ctrl key is pressed. Ctrl+Win+F4 is a new shortcut to close virtual desktops, so we don't want to prevent that. Thanks to Jos√© Rebelo.
- Add a process blacklist, with <tt>explorer.exe</tt> in the list by default.

I apologize for my tardiness. I use Windows less and less every year, and I must confess that I have not even been running my own programs when I do. I hope this release makes up for it somewhat.
