Released 1.3.

The installer now defaults to install to the <tt>%APPDATA%</tt> directory, so it won't ask for administrator privileges when you start it. If you want to install to <tt>Program Files</tt>, right-click the installer and select <tt>Run as administrator</tt>.

**Due to this change in the installer, I recommend that you uninstall and install from scratch if you are upgrading from a previous version!**

Lastly, I want to thank everyone who have donated. All support is greatly appreciated!
