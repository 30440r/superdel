# SuperF4 v1.3

2015-08-23:
- Moved website to GitHub.
- Updated the installer to install to `APPDATA` by default. It no longer asks for administrator privileges.
- Added the ability to elevate SuperF4. You need this to kill programs running with administrator privileges.
- Removed update checker.
- Removed all translations.
- Removed the ability to hide the tray icon.

The reason why I am removing so many features is because I want to make the code cleaner and more compact.
